<!-- Bouncing Ball (Doodle Jump Improvement)
The purpose of this game is to utilize my programming knowledge to envision, design, and ultimately play an improved video game based on "Doodle Jump," a popular computer game game in which the player jumps vertically along platforms to gain a high score while staying within bounds of the screen.

Description
In my desiging of "Pink Rush," my first video game, I stumbled upon collision detection completely by accident.
