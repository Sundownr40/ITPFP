Bouncing Ball (Doodle Jump Improvement)
The purpose of this game is to utilize my programming knowledge to envision, design, and ultimately play an improved video game based on "Doodle Jump," a popular computer game in which the player jumps vertically along platforms to gain a high score while staying within bounds of the screen.

Description
In designing "Pink Rush," my first video game, I stumbled upon collision detection completely by accident. Using this knowledge, I decided to create a game that would utilize this principle - collision - as the cornerstone for my project. Platforms that the player will be able to interact with via jumping will be organized vertically along the screen, enabling the player to traverse left or right to navigate the platforms while avoiding falling off to their death. The higher the player "jumps," the more the player's score will be. Some platforms will have the ability to move, others will act as stationery. I will add some additional features such as increased customizability, coloring, and various modes to play.
